# Update
 - [x] start to use obsidian.md to streamlined notetaking and markdown style format editing.
 - [x] use latex complter and Latex Suite (not yet) to streamline the process of notetaking.
- [ ] update .gitignore to ignore some of the json file in .obsidian, since it will conflicts the repo if I decide to use in mobile.
